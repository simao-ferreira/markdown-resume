# Markdown resume

This is a simple script to build a pdf resume based on a markdown file and css style.
It loads the default resume file, loads a css file from assets/styles folder and generates or overrides a pdf file to
output folder.

A style can be given as argument, if not, will default to a [simple style](markdown2pdf/assets/styles/simple-style.css).
The resume markdown file can be found [here](markdown2pdf/assets/resume.md).

*WARNING* this is a work in progress
