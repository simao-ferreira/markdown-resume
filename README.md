# Markdown resume

This is a simple script to build a pdf resume based on a markdown file and css style.
It looks for a `RESUME.md` file, loads a css file from styles folder and generates or overrides a pdf file to output
folder.

A style can be given as argument, if not will default to a [simple style](styles/simple-style.css).

The resume markdown file can be found [here](resume/RESUME.md)
